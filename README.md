# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020
Our project uses datasets provided by NASA'S Goddard Institute for Space Studies(GISS) which monitors Climate Change on a global level. Since Co2 is one of the major greenhouse gases which is responsible for global surface temperature rise, we took the data of global surface-air temperature rise and global co2 concentration in(ppm) from 1958 to till date.
Using this data we developed a predictive ML model which predicts global temperature rise for the future years with respective to the concentration of co2 in our atmosphere. Using this we also made a visual representation of how the surface temperature has risen from 1890 to 2020 with interactive 3D graphics.
